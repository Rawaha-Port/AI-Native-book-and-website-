# Placeholder for Better Auth OpenAPI Specification

# This file would contain the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for the authentication
# endpoints exposed by the better_auth_service, if such a specification were
# generated or maintained for external consumption.
#
# Since better-auth is a library primarily consumed programmatically, its
# "contract" is largely defined by its TypeScript/JavaScript API.
