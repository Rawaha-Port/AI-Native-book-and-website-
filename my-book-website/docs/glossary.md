# Glossary

---

**A***
: A path search algorithm used to find the shortest path between a start and goal node in a graph or grid, commonly used in robot navigation.

**Actuator**
: A component of a robot that converts energy (usually electrical) into physical motion, acting as the "muscles" of the robot. Examples include electric motors and hydraulic pistons.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**
: The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

**Bipedal Locomotion**
: The act of moving by means of two rear limbs or legs. For humanoid robots, this is a dynamically challenging task that requires sophisticated balance control.

**Computer Vision**
: A field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world, enabling robots to "see" and process information from images and videos.

**Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Parameters**
: A standardized convention for assigning coordinate frames to the links of a robot arm, used to simplify the derivation of forward kinematics equations.

**Dynamics**
: The study of motion and the forces and torques that cause it. In robotics, it helps predict how a robot will move in response to motor commands and external forces.

**Embodied Intelligence**
: A principle in AI suggesting that intelligence is not purely computational but is deeply connected to having a physical body that can sense and interact with the world.

**Encoder**
: A proprioceptive sensor attached to a motor shaft that measures the precise angle of a joint, providing critical feedback for position control.

**Exteroceptive Sensors**
: Sensors that gather information about the external environment around the robot. Examples include cameras, LiDAR, and microphones.

**Forward Kinematics (FK)**
: The process of calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector (e.g., its hand) based on the known angles of its joints.

**Gazebo**
: A popular, open-source 3D robotics simulator that offers realistic physics and sensor models, commonly used with ROS.

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**
: A multidisciplinary field focused on the design, evaluation, and understanding of interactions between humans and robots.

**Imitation Learning**
: A machine learning approach where a robot learns a new skill by observing and mimicking a demonstration performed by a human.

**Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**
: A sensor that combines an accelerometer and a gyroscope to measure a robot's orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration, essential for balance.

**Inverse Kinematics (IK)**
: The process of calculating the required joint angles for a robot to move its end-effector to a desired position and orientation in space.

**Kinematics**
: The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it, focusing on the geometry of movement.

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**
: A sensing method that uses pulsed laser beams to measure distances and create precise 3D maps of the environment, known as point clouds.

**Machine Learning (ML)**
: A subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make predictions on data, without being explicitly programmed for the task.

**PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control**
: A widely used feedback control algorithm that calculates a corrective output based on the present error (Proportional), accumulated past errors (Integral), and the predicted future error (Derivative).

**Physical AI**
: A branch of AI focused on intelligent systems that are embodied in a physical form and can sense, act, and learn through interaction with the physical world.

**Proprioceptive Sensors**
: Sensors that monitor the internal state of the robot itself, such as joint angles, motor temperature, or battery level.

**PyBullet**
: A fast, easy-to-use, Python-based physics engine and robotics simulation library, widely used in research and education.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
: A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties, learning through trial and error.

**Robot Operating System (ROS)**
: A flexible framework and set of tools for writing robot software. It provides a modular, message-passing system for controlling complex robotic systems.

**Series Elastic Actuator (SEA)**
: A type of actuator that includes a spring or other elastic element in series with the motor. This provides compliance and enables accurate force sensing, making physical interactions safer.

**Sim-to-Real Transfer**
: The process and challenge of transferring policies or models learned in a simulation to a physical, real-world robot, while accounting for the "reality gap."

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**
: A class of algorithms that allows a mobile robot to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of its own location within that map.

**Uncanny Valley**
: A hypothesis in HRI that describes the dip in human affinity for a robot or character whose appearance is almost, but not perfectly, human-like, causing a feeling of unease or revulsion.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**
: A standard XML file format used in ROS and other simulators to describe the physical properties of a robot, including its links, joints, sensors, and visuals.

**Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**
: A key concept in bipedal locomotion. For a robot to be stable, the ZMP—the point on the ground where the net moment from inertial and gravitational forces is zero—must stay within the support polygon formed by its feet.
