## User Input

```text
/sp.plan
```

## Response

The agent successfully executed the planning phase for the `user-auth` feature.
The following artifacts were generated:
- `specs/001-user-auth/plan.md`: The implementation plan outlining the technical approach.
- `specs/001-user-auth/research.md`: Research document detailing the technology choices.

The next suggested step is to proceed with task breakdown using the `/sp.tasks` command.
